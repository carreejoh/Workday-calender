# Workday-calender
A website designed to organize your day and visually show you what time it is.

# Description
This site uses dayjs and an interval to continously check what time it is and change div colors to inform the user of what hour it is. It also has the date at the top of the screen. The calender takes in user input and saves it to local storage, so they can view it as long as their browser is open.
